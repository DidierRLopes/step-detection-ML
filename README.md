# Step Detection using SVM on NURVV trackers

| Notebook | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| [Nurvv Classifier](https://github.com/DidierRLopes/step-detection-SVM/blob/main/Nurvv_Classifier.ipynb) | Understand Nurvv IMU samples, and if there's a way to classify step/no-step using an unsupervised method. |
| [Nurvv K-Means and Feature Extraction](https://github.com/DidierRLopes/step-detection-SVM/blob/main/Nurvv_KMeansFeatureExtraction.ipynb) | Extract insights from K-Means on Nurvv IMU data and try some feature extraction. |
| [Nurvv from EDA to SVM](https://github.com/DidierRLopes/step-detection-SVM/blob/main/Nurvv_fromEDAtoSVM.ipynb) | Reports the entire journey from performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the IMU samples, to the signal processing used to label data, and to finally applying Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify the samples of a model into step or no-step. |
| [Nurvv Pipeline](https://github.com/DidierRLopes/step-detection-SVM/blob/main/Nurvv_Pipeline.ipynb) | Implement a data pipeline to perform ensemble SVM with multiple models. |
